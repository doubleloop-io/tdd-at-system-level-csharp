# TDD at system level

- You can find a description of the exercise in [EXERCISE.md](EXERCISE.md)
- You can find an example of the csv format we should use in `data/employees.csv`

### How to use the repo
- Clone the repo + run the test. Everything should be green.
- We have branches for specific checkpoints. To be all at the same starting point during class I'll ask you to checkout a specific branch. Please do it.
- Example workflow:
  - `git checkout 01-e2e-test`
  - run tests -> all green
  - coding time + commit frequently
  - Time to go to checkpoint-2 with `git checkout 02-xxx`
